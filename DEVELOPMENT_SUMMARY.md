## Key Technical Improvements

### Component Architecture
1. **ImageUpload Component**
   - Added `showPreview` prop to control image display
   - Prevents duplicate image previews
   - Maintains secure file handling

2. **ChatInterface Component**
   - Conditional rendering based on workflow
   - Smart auto-prompt filling with user intent tracking
   - Dual image display system (upload + preview)

3. **ImagePreview Component**
   - Removed resize functionality (per user request)
   - Maintained crop and download capabilities
   - Aspect ratio selection preserved

### State Management
